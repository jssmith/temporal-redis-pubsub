# Temporal Streaming with Redis PubSub

A solution for real-time streaming output from Temporal workflows using Redis PubSub. This addresses the limitation that Temporal doesn't natively support streaming responses from an LLM.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement real-time streaming from Temporal workflows by using Redis PubSub as a communication channel. This demonstration focuses specifically on streaming LLM output back to the user via CLI, while also persisting results to the Temporal Activity.

## How It Works

1. A Temporal workflow is defined that executes an activity
2. The activity streams its output to a Redis PubSub channel character by character
3. A client subscribes to the channel and displays the stream in real-time in the terminal
4. The workflow completes once all streaming is finished

## Requirements

- Anthropic API key
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) [Python project manager]
- Redis server (e.g. `brew install redis`)
- [Temporal server](https://docs.temporal.io/cli#install)

## Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

1. Start a Redis server in a separate terminal:
```bash
redis-server # Validate it's running in another terminal by running 'redi-cli ping' --> response should be 'pong'
```

2. Start a Temporal server in a separate terminal:
```bash
temporal server start-dev # Open the Temporal UI on localhost:8233
```

3. Start the Worker from the original virtual environment:
```bash
uv run python -m worker
```

4. Start the Workflow from a new terminal with the virtual environment
```bash
uv run python -m starter
```
